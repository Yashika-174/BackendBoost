- Helps avoid over-fetching, especially for mobile clients or slow networks.

### üì® Email Sending with Nodemailer
- Sends automated emails on **registration**, **contact requests**, or **news notifications**.
- Built using `nodemailer` with SMTP configuration.
- Ready to integrate for:
- Email Verification
- Password Reset
- News Alert Subscriptions

### üîÑ API Transformation
- Only **relevant data** is exposed in API responses.
- Utilizes `select` in Prisma to shape the response body (e.g., removing password from user data).
- Helpful for mobile apps and frontends that require specific fields only.

### üîÉ Queue (Scalable Ready)
- **Planned**: Queue system using **BullMQ + Redis** for:
- Email processing
- Background jobs
- Image processing
- Queue integration will decouple user-facing APIs from heavy background operations.
